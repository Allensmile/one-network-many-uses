Requires following packages:
- PyTorch
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Dataset NOT included (please download separately)

To follow along, you'll need to download the Flickr8K dataset. Fill [this form](https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1713398) and you'll receive a download link on your email. Extract the zip file in the 'Flicker8k_Dataset' folder in the same directory as your notebook. You'll also need to download captions [from here](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepimagesent/caption_datasets.zip). Extract captions in the folder 'caption_datasets'.
